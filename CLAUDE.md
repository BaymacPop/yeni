# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This directory contains a Claude CLI configuration setup with MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers configured for GitHub and context7-mcp integration.

## Configuration

The project uses `claude_config.json` to configure MCP servers:
- **GitHub MCP Server**: Provides GitHub integration capabilities
- **Context7 MCP Server**: Provides context management functionality

## Important Notes

1. The HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files in this directory are macOS aliases (shortcuts) pointing to files in another location, not actual source files.
2. This is primarily a Claude CLI workspace configuration directory, not a traditional programming project.
3. The actual web development files that the aliases reference appear to be located elsewhere on the system.

## Working with Aliases

When working with the aliased files (index.html, script.js, styles.css), be aware that:
- These are not the actual files but shortcuts
- Modifications should be made to the original files, not the aliases
- The original files may be located in `/Applications/newpro/` or another directory
